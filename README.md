Once MagicSpells v4.0 rolls around and is deemed stable, this fork will be updated accordingly.

For anyone seeking support: this version of MagicSpells is updated for the Pwing Minecraft Server (pwing.net) and you will recieve NO SUPPORT for using this fork. This build is solely here for the Pwing developers and if you have any intention of using it, you are free to do so, but keep in mind you will recieve no support.
